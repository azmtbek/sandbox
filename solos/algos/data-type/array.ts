/**
 * An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. The most basic
 * implementation of an array is a static array, in which the array has a fixed
 * size that must be declared when it is initialized. In technical interviews,
 * youâ€™re also going to come across questions about dynamic arrays (similar to static 
 * arrays, but with space reserved for additional elements) and multidimensional arrays 
 * (arrays in which the individual elements are also arrays).
